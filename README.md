# What am I looking at?
Code to solve a continuous task with RL.
The main file is dqn.py.
It implements an RL agent, using deep q learning.
Building blocks of the agent are in various files, eg memory.py and policy.py.
If you want to code your own implementations of these, feel free, we can help if needed :)
